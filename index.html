                A deep-dive into why Akshata Murty’s G20 stylings stood-out among the people
            </h2>
            <p>
                The practice of expressing oneself through the means of fashion was portrayed beautifully in the mainstream media by There First Lady, Akshata Murty. Her wardrobe gained everyone’s attention on social media as soon as she made her first appearance with
                Rishi Sunak. After a lot of harsh criticism from the media labelling her as “quiet luxury to her shifting her style to sustaninable and modest, Her style at the G20 was “Oh so gracious” and on the point with the mixture of some beautiful
                colour combinations that it left us with tons of outfit recommendations for the season! The huge buzz from her fashion statements tormented the question of importance of personal styles carving a personality among female leaders and the
                sense of freedom in the sense of presenting yourself as the person you are is so empowering. Whether it was Jayalalitha’s draping of the saree like a cape shielding her against the world, or Hillary Clinton’s "She just wanted to create
                something simple, almost like a uniform in a way," it’s an empowering piece of their individuality.

                Having a degree of Fashion clearly made sense through her touchdown outfit on Friday in Delhi for the G-20 in a poplin white shirt by the British Label With Noting Underneath, a favourite of her costing £150. This was tucked-inside a full-length beautifully
                printed, brown skirt. An understated yet fun look. This choice of clothing spoke business regardless of her going for a usual formal looks. The main element that pulled the whole outfit together was her comfort and confidence in the outfit
                that made all eyes on the UK’s First Lady named as Britain’s best dressed for 2023 by Tatler Magazine.

                The carefully chosen outfits for multiple G20 summit were thoughtfully curated to convey significant messages about their connection to India, traditional craftsmanship, and dedication to sustainable fashion.

                During the recent G20 dinner hosted by President Droupadi Murmu at the Bharat Mandapam, Akshata Murtys appeared in a midi dress made of silk georgette. This elegant dress presented extended sleeves with a floral print. It was accompanied by an ankle-length
                tiered skirt that cinched at the waist. The attire was brought to life by vibrant hues like coral pink, sky blue, and mint green. Akshata harmonized her look with statement diamond dangling earrings, multiple rings, and a golden clutch.
                The attire's true beauty lays in its origin. This unique dress hails from the Saloni label, a brand founded by a London-based designer of Indian descent. Saloni is instrumental in Connecting For India, a community that bridges the gap
                between ancient Indian craft traditions and contemporary collaborations.

                Earlier in the day, at the G20 Spouses Programme's millet exhibition hosted by Kyoko, the wife of India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Akshata wore a lilac "Valli" dress from Manimekala, a British-Indian slow fashion brand known for its made-to-order
                approach. The dress featured a marbling print on soft organic cotton, billowing puff sleeves, and an A-line skirt with a flowy tiered hem and practical pockets. According to Manimekala Fuller, the brand's half-Indian, half-British founder
                and designer, the Valli dress adds a feminine twist to a classic shirt style. Manimekala expressed her gratitude to the First Lady, commending her for spotlighting female-owned brands, both in India and throughout the diaspora. She also
                lauded Akshata's preference for smaller labels committed to sustainable and ethical practices, promoting a more deliberate and environmentally conscious approach to fashion.

                Upon her arrival at the summit, Akshata chose to wear an orange co-ord set from Drawn, an Indian brand known as the "Wild Iris" set. Drawn, an independent ready-to-wear fashion brand found by Rhea Bhattacharya based in India, focuses on conscious consumption
                and employs a preorder shopping model to regulate production, offering limited runs of wearable art.

                More recently, Murty made a calculated decision to pay homage to her Indian heritage on her travel to India for the G20 Summit and chose to highlight Indian fashion brands like Dawn, FabIndia, and Raw Mango. This was more than just a simple wardrobe decision—it
                was fashion diplomacy. The UK Prime Minister and Akshata Murty visited the Akshardham temple in New Delhi while on the tour. After taking part in a puja and other procedures, they spoke with the pujaris. In a magenta-pink and green salwar
                suit, Akshata kept her appearance understated. The green tunic had flowery designs and came with palazzo trousers and a magenta-pink dupatta.

                The phrase “last but not the least” becomes immensely relevant as Akshata’s departure outfit became one of the most talked-about from the entire collection. She opted for a gorgeous pink Chanderi saree which was perfect for the weather. The word understated
                is used a lot but rightly so.

                While this wasn’t the first time of using Fashion as a strategical tool with a mixture of low/high brands, it was Akshata’s ability to trasition between every style naturally and using the stage to positively promote sustainably. The Stanford grad who
                was born in Hubli is the daughter of renowned novelist and philanthropist Sudha Murty, the first female engineer to work for TATA Engineering and Locomotive Company. The IT behemoth Infosys was co-founded by her father, Narayana Murty.
                Even though her ancestry has already established her as royalty in the eyes of many Indians, she and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have grown to be among the wealthiest in the UK. Murty has experience in the fashion industry and started
                her own label to promote Indian workmanship. She holds a certification from the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising. We're keeping an eye out for additional fashion-forward moments from Murty as the G20 meeting draws attention
                to her.
